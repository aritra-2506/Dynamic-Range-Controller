# Dynamic-Range-Controller


Dynamic range of a signal is defined as the logarithmic ratio of maximum to minimum amplitude of a signal and is expressed in dB.
Dynamic Range of a signal can be controlled using an application named as Dynamic Range Control (DRC). It can amplify low level sounds or reduce the volume of high level sounds.
First phase of DRC will only have features of Compressor (RMS).
Next phases will have features of Compressor (Peak), Expander, Limiter and Noise Gate respectively.
