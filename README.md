# Dynamic-Range-Controller


Dynamic range of a signal is defined as the logarithmic ratio of maximum to minimum amplitude of a signal and is expressed in dB.
Dynamic Range of a signal can be controlled using an application named as Dynamic Range Control (DRC). It can amplify low level sounds or reduce the volume of high level sounds. It has 5 different operating modes - 
1. Compressor (RMS)
2. Compressor (Peak)
3. Limiter
4. Expander
5. Noise Gate.

The web implementation of drc looked like 'drc.png' uploaded here.

Is is used to compare how the audio quality and the signal time plot and it's dynamic range change with change in different parameters like Ratio, Threshold, Attack, Release, Hold etc.
